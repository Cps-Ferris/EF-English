### 每日语句

```
May I have your name? 

Pardon ?
Can you repeat that, please? 


I like dogs # 一般说喜欢形容种类
I like this dog


What does he look like?
他看起来怎么样？

Almost nothing. 
几乎没有


What company do you work for?	
您在哪家公司上班？


I play basketball with my friends on the weekend. 

I have never been there before.
I have been to both of them.

疑问句做并于从句时，使用陈述句式
I don't know who he is.
Do you know where the bank is?


介词后接名词或动名词 (verb + -ing)。
What about a game of cards?    	玩牌怎么样？
How about watching a movie?	看电影怎么样？

```



### 每日语法

#### Be动词 助动词

```
what do you do what is your job
那么这里选用do和is有什么根据呢？
第一句里面，第二个do是指你做什么，也就是你的工作，就是一个实义动词。按中文说，what you do已经足够了。可是英语里面就不行，必须跟一个助动词，也就是do.
这里就有了一个结论：当句子中有动词时，我们就用助动词do或是does.如果没有动词时，我们就选用is或是are，也就是b“Be”除了原形的“be”之外，还有另外七种形式：am, is, are, been, being, was, were.
```



#### 名词复数

```
1. 一般情况加s。
2. 以s,x, sh, ch结尾加es，读/iz/。
3. 以辅音字母+y结尾，变y为i再加es，读/iz/。
4. 以y结尾的专有名词或元音字母+y结尾的名词变复数时，直接加s，读/z/
5. 以o结尾的名词，有些加词尾-s，有些加-es，有些加-s或-es均可。
6. 以f，fe结尾，去f，fe变ves。
```



#### to do / doing

```
出生 —— to do （不定态）
存续 —— doing （进行态 ）
死亡 —— done （完成态）
我们知道 to do 和 doing 是动词的两个不同的发展阶段，to do 表示还未发生，而doing表示正在发生
所以凡是需要表示还未发生的那么就接动词 to do， 凡是已经发生，或者正在发生的，那么就用动词doing

I like playing basketball. 我喜欢打篮球
I like to play basketball today. 我今天想打篮球
```



#### 动名词做主语

> 动名词是由动词 -ing 形式构成的名词。

```
She loves swimming.            	她爱游泳
I like cooking for my family.	我喜欢为我的家人做饭
He enjoys playing soccer.	他喜欢踢足球
```

> 与其他名词一样，动名词也可作句子主语。

```
Swimming is her favorite activity.  	游泳是她最爱的活动
Playing soccer is good exercise.		踢足球是一种很好的锻炼
Cooking for my family is a lot of fun.	为我的家人做饭充满趣味
```



#### 表达频率

> 你可以使用频率副词表达你多久做某事一次。频率副词程度不一，有从表示最高频率的 **always** 到表示某事从未发生的 **never**。

|      | 100% = *always*   | 100% = 总是 |
| ---- | ----------------- | ----------- |
|      | 80% = *usually*   | 80% = 通常  |
|      | 60% = *often*     | 60% = 常常  |
|      | 40% = *sometimes* | 40% = 有时  |
|      | 20% = rarely      | 20% = 很少  |
|      | 0% = *never*      | 0% = 从未   |



> 频率副词位于句中 **be** 动词之后，但在所有其他动词的前面。

|      | A: *Are you ever late to work?* B: *No, **I'm never** late!* | 你上班迟到过吗？ 不，我从没迟到过。     |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
|      | A: *How often do you go to the theater?* B: *I **rarely go**. It's too expensive.* | 你多久去一次电影院？ 我很少去。太贵了。 |



#### **表达持续时间** 

> 使用动词 **last** 谈论某事从开始到结束的持续时间。

```
A: How long does Carnaval last?		嘉年华持续多长时间？
B: The big events last a few days.	大规模的活动持续几天。
```



> 使用动词 **take** 谈论完成某事所需的时间。

```
A: How long does it take to walk from the hotel to the parade?从酒店来到游行现场步行需要多久？
B: It takes a half-hour.	需要半小时。

```

```
