> #### 谓语动词三大本领
>
> 1. 表示动作的时间：现在，过去，将来，从过去某个时间点"算将来"(过去将来)
>
> 2. 表示动作的状态：未说明(一般)，完成，进行，不但完成而且继续(完成进行)
>
>    时间和状态成为时态，自由排列组合有16中时态
>
> 3. 表示动作的假设，情感等： If I were a rabbit. 虚拟语气，这里用were而不是was暗示 并自己并不是兔子
>
> 合称：TAM：时(Tense) 体(Aspect) 气(Mood) 
>
> 英语的谓语动词本身往往是不能独立完成刚才所说的那些本领，需要助动词来帮助，例如：吃 Eat
>
> 1. 为了协助它表示吃过了(完成态),就要用到助动词, have,  have eaten.
> 2. 为了协助它表示正在吃(进行态),就要用到助动词, be,  is eating.
> 3. 为了协助它表示是"被"吃,就要用到助动词be, is eaten.
> 4. 为了协助它表示有能力吃,就要用到助动词can,  can eat.
> 5. 为了协助它表示有可能吃,就要用到助动词might,  might eat.
> 6. 为了协助它表示有义务吃,就要用的助动词must,  must eat.
> 7. 为了协助它表示否定,不吃,就需要用到助动词do, do not eat.
>
> 不要把助动词和其他身份(实义动词)弄混淆



> #### 非谓语动词
>
> 1. 动词不定式 to eat  
> 2. 现在分词 eating
> 3. 动名词 eating
> 4. 过去分词 eaten
>
> 并不能确定是动词不定式还是动词原形



> #### 谓语动词vs非谓语动词
>
> 谓语动词进行修改可以改为非谓语动词，非谓语动词几乎可以取代所有的从句，从而简化句子
>
> 只不过这样的动词就不再具有表示动作时间，状态，语态，语气的功能



#### 并列复合句(复合句)

> 并列关系的复合句



#### 主从复合句(复杂句)

> 从属关系的复杂巨，包括主句和从句，从句可以充当所有句子的成分

疑问句做并于从句时，使用陈述句式

```



### 每日语法

#### Be动词 助动词

```
what do you do what is your job
那么这里选用do和is有什么根据呢？
第一句里面，第二个do是指你做什么，也就是你的工作，就是一个实义动词。按中文说，what you do已经足够了。可是英语里面就不行，必须跟一个助动词，也就是do.
这里就有了一个结论：当句子中有动词时，我们就用助动词do或是does.如果没有动词时，我们就选用is或是are，也就是b“Be”除了原形的“be”之外，还有另外七种形式：am, is, are, been, being, was, were.
```



#### 名词复数

```
1. 一般情况加s。
2. 以s,x, sh, ch结尾加es，读/iz/。
3. 以辅音字母+y结尾，变y为i再加es，读/iz/。
4. 以y结尾的专有名词或元音字母+y结尾的名词变复数时，直接加s，读/z/
5. 以o结尾的名词，有些加词尾-s，有些加-es，有些加-s或-es均可。
6. 以f，fe结尾，去f，fe变ves。
```



#### to do / doing

```
出生 —— to do （不定态）
存续 —— doing （进行态 ）
死亡 —— done （完成态）
我们知道 to do 和 doing 是动词的两个不同的发展阶段，to do 表示还未发生，而doing表示正在发生
所以凡是需要表示还未发生的那么就接动词 to do， 凡是已经发生，或者正在发生的，那么就用动词doing

I like playing basketball. 我喜欢打篮球
I like to play basketball today. 我今天想打篮球
```



#### 动名词做主语

> 动名词是由动词 -ing 形式构成的名词。

```
She loves swimming.            	她爱游泳
I like cooking for my family.	我喜欢为我的家人做饭
He enjoys playing soccer.	他喜欢踢足球
```

> 与其他名词一样，动名词也可作句子主语。

```
Swimming is her favorite activity.  	游泳是她最爱的活动
Playing soccer is good exercise.		踢足球是一种很好的锻炼
Cooking for my family is a lot of fun.	为我的家人做饭充满趣味
```



#### 表达频率

> 你可以使用频率副词表达你多久做某事一次。频率副词程度不一，有从表示最高频率的 **always** 到表示某事从未发生的 **never**。

|      | 100% = *always*   | 100% = 总是 |
| ---- | ----------------- | ----------- |
|      | 80% = *usually*   | 80% = 通常  |
|      | 60% = *often*     | 60% = 常常  |
|      | 40% = *sometimes* | 40% = 有时  |
|      | 20% = rarely      | 20% = 很少  |
|      | 0% = *never*      | 0% = 从未   |



> 频率副词位于句中 **be** 动词之后，但在所有其他动词的前面。

|      | A: *Are you ever late to work?* B: *No, **I'm never** late!* | 你上班迟到过吗？ 不，我从没迟到过。     |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
|      | A: *How often do you go to the theater?* B: *I **rarely go**. It's too expensive.* | 你多久去一次电影院？ 我很少去。太贵了。 |



#### **表达持续时间** 

> 使用动词 **last** 谈论某事从开始到结束的持续时间。

```
A: How long does Carnaval last?		嘉年华持续多长时间？
B: The big events last a few days.	大规模的活动持续几天。
```



> 使用动词 **take** 谈论完成某事所需的时间。

```
A: How long does it take to walk from the hotel to the parade?从酒店来到游行现场步行需要多久？
B: It takes a half-hour.	需要半小时。

```



>使用介词 **for** 表示某事持续的时间。

```
We celebrate for a week.	我们庆祝了一个星期。
```



> 使用介词 **during** 表示某事在一段时间内发生。

```
I party a lot during the summer.	夏天我参加了很多派对。              
What do you do during Carnaval?		嘉年华你做什么？         
```
